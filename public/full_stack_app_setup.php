/*
envision your views (index, detail page, logins, sign-up)
I have X and Y things, what are the relationships between them?
determining where/if we put foreign keys
	where X is a User
	and Y is a blog post
	how many authors could the blog post have?
	how many blog posts could the author have?

Workflow:
- create migrations (way of version-controlling our db structure) (these are just text file that create, modify, and delete tables or columns on tables)
- create and run seeders as necessary
- view the app
- first place to start is w/ a var_dump()
